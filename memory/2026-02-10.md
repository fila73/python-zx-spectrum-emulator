# 2026-02-10 - Progress Update

## Today's Milestones

1.  **Z80 Block I/O Accuracy:**
    *   Fixed port address logic: `INI/IND` now correctly use `B_old` while `OUTI/OUTD` use `B_new`.
    *   Improved `H` and `C` flag separation in block I/O instructions.
    *   Extensively investigated NMOS-specific `P/V` flag formulas involving the 4-bit ALU internal carry.
    *   Achieved partial progress on `edb2.json` and others, though ~500 failures per suite remain due to complex undocumented flag interactions.

## Current Status
- **CPU Accuracy:** 1084/1092 suites passing.
- **Block I/O:** Port addresses verified and fixed. Undocumented flags (H, P/V) are the last hurdle for 100% Z80 standard test passing.

## Next Actions
- [x] Correct port address logic for block I/O (INI/IND/OUTI/OUTD).
- [ ] Fix emulator timing to match 50Hz (Task 039).
- [ ] Perfect Z80 block I/O flags (moved to Ideas).
- [ ] Implement missing 128K hardware features if needed.
