# Rules of Žolíky (Rummy)

## Deck
- Two standard 52-card decks + 4 Jokers (total 108 cards).

## Objective
- Empty your hand by forming valid sets and sequences on the table.

## Card Values
- 2-10: Face value.
- J, Q, K: 10 points each.
- Ace: 1 point in a low sequence (A-2-3), 11 points in a high sequence (Q-K-A), or 10 points in a set.
- Joker: Value of the card it replaces.

## Valid Combinations
- **Sequence (Postupka):** 3+ consecutive cards of the same suit.
- **Set (Skupina):** 3 or 4 cards of the same rank but different suits.

## Initial Meld (Vyložení)
- To meld for the first time, the total value of combinations must be at least **42 points**.
- Must include at least one "pure" sequence (without a Joker).

## Joker Rules
- A Joker can replace any card.
- If a player has the real card that a Joker on the table represents, they can swap it and take the Joker into their hand (only if they have already melded).

## Winning
- The round ends when a player discards their last card onto the discard pile.
