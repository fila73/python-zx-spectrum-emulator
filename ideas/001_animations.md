# Idea: Animation and Card Transitions

Implement smooth animations when drawing cards, discarding, or moving cards into melds. This will significantly improve the user experience and make the game feel "alive".
- Use Compose `animateContentSize` or `AnimatedVisibility`.
- Particle effects for "Žolík!" swap.
