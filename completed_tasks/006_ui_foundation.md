# Task 006: UI Foundation (Jetpack Compose)

## Description
Initialize the Jetpack Compose environment and create basic screen scaffolding for the game.

## Requirements
- Add necessary dependencies to `build.gradle.kts` (Compose, Material 3, ViewModel).
- Create a `MainActivity` that hosts the Compose content.
- Implement a basic `GameScreen` with placeholders for:
    - Player's hand (horizontal list of cards).
    - Game table (discard pile and active melds).
    - Basic "Draw" and "Discard" buttons.
- Setup a basic `GameViewModel` to bridge `GameTable` logic with the UI.

## Model Selection
- **gemini-3-flash-preview**: Suitable for UI scaffolding and boilerplate setup.

## Priority: High
