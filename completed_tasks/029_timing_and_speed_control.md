# Task: Timing and Speed Control

1. [ ] Implement a frame rate limiter in `emulator.py` to target exactly 50.08 Hz.
2. [ ] Synchronize CPU execution with real-time (approx. 69888 T-states per frame).
3. [ ] Improve high-precision sleeping to prevent "running too fast" issues.
4. [ ] Ensure audio buffer generation is perfectly synced with the frame limit to eliminate sound distortion.
5. [ ] Verify that 1 real second corresponds to 1 emulated second.
