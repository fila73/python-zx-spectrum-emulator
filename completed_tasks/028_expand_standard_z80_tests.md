# Task: Expand Standard Z80 Tests

1. [ ] Analyze remaining 62 failing test suites in `tests/z80_standard/`.
2. [ ] Identify specific undocumented flag discrepancies (bits 3 and 5).
3. [ ] Implement remaining logic for perfect flag fidelity (e.g., bits 3 and 5 in ALU and BIT instructions).
4. [ ] Ensure 1092/1092 test suites pass.
5. [ ] Verify no performance regressions from increased accuracy.
