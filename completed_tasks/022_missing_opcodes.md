# Task: Implement Missing Z80 Opcodes

1. Audit 'src/cpu.py' for unimplemented opcodes (those currently calling _unimplemented_opcode).
2. Implement missing 8-bit Load/Exchange instructions.
3. Implement missing Arithmetic/Logic instructions (including DAA, CPL, SCF, CCF).
4. Implement missing Bit instructions (shifts/rotates not yet covered).
5. Verify with comprehensive test suites (e.g., ZEXALL or similar if available, or custom instruction tests).
