# Task 007: Visual UI Enhancement (Card Assets)

## Description
Replace the current text-based placeholders in the `GameScreen` with the actual graphical card assets.

## Requirements
- Update `PlayingCard` Composable to display the correct image based on the card's suit and rank.
- Update `CardPlaceholder` for the Deck to use `blue_revers.png`.
- Update the Discard Pile to show the actual top card image.
- Ensure the cards maintain their aspect ratio (172:280) in the UI.

## Model Selection
- **gemini-3-flash-preview**: Best for UI implementation and resource mapping.

## Priority: High
