# Task 007: Card UI Implementation

## Description
Replace the placeholder card UI with a proper visual representation and implement interactive mechanics (dragging/selecting) for the player's hand.

## Requirements
- **Card Visuals**:
    - Implement `CardView` composable that renders Rank and Suit visually.
    - Use distinct colors for suits (Red: Hearts/Diamonds, Black: Spades/Clubs).
    - Add visual distinction for Joker.
- **Hand Interaction**:
    - Allow selecting cards (toggle selection).
    - Implement basic "drag and drop" reordering within the hand (optional but good for UX).
    - Ensure the hand scrolls horizontally if cards overflow.
- **Table Interaction**:
    - Visualize the Discard Pile top card.
    - Visualize the Deck (face down).

## Priority: High
