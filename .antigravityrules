# Žolíky (Android) - Agent Rules

## Development Guidelines
- Prioritize Kotlin 2.0 and Jetpack Compose.
- Follow MVVM pattern strictly.
- Ensure all logic aligns with the rules in `docs/rules.md`.
- **Workflow:** State Audit -> Code Analysis -> Action Phase -> Planning -> Version Control -> Reporting.

## Task & Idea Management
- **One file per item:** Keep only one task or idea per Markdown file.
- **Manage Tasks:** Move finished task files from `current_tasks/` to `completed_tasks/`. Create new specific tasks as needed.
- **Manage Ideas:** Add new ideas to `ideas/` (one per file).
- **Planning:** Always create new task files in `current_tasks/` for the next logical steps before finishing an iteration.

## Version Control
- Commit after every significant milestone or successful implementation: `git add` and `git commit -m "Brief description"`.

## Logging Guidelines
- Summary of actions, results, and plans MUST be recorded in `agent_logs/`.
- Filename format: `agent_manual_$(git rev-parse --short=6 HEAD)_$(date +%s).log`.
- Fallback filename: `agent_manual_no-git_$(date +%s).log`.

## Comment Styles
- Use English comments followed by a Czech translation.
- Be verbose in explaining game mechanics and UI logic.
- **Encoding:** Always save files in **UTF-8**.
